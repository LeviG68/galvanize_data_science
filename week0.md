### Week 0 of the Data Science Immersive:  
#### It's '0' Because Python is Zero-Indexed...  

##### Brief forward  
I was worried about keeping up. I wasn't a coder before - I don't have a STEM background. I did Excel and and logical analysis (qualitative). I know I'm smart enough, but was worrying about being the 'dumb' one in the class. For anyone else in the same boat - __don't worry__. In my class there are PhD's and there are bartenders. It really seems to be what you put into the coursework that determines what you get at the end. There were college dropouts (smart ones, but still, no college or work experience) who worked their tails off during a cohort two prior who got jobs within two months. Good jobs. 80-100k salaries.

What I've been told basically follows the trajectory of the old adage, 'Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.' If you do the program and give it your all, really commit to learning and not giving up, the setup here is one to make you succeed. All my fellow students are smart. And helpful. And sometimes need help with things I can solve. There are smart teachers who can answer complex questions, debug code in a matter of minutes, or give helpful examples of where to put your time and effort for the next few weeks, or so it seems. I'll have more details on this in the coming weeks.  

1. __Python practice__  
 * This whole week was coding. Not coding particularly elegant or necessary code, but learning how you could do x, y, or z four or five different ways. Some things we worked on were immediately replaced with a single module plug-in (foe example, computing the standard error or the distance between two points in a two dimensional plane).  Some days I felt like I was the 'slowest' in the room, others I finished or grasped a few concepts in a matter of seconds. Erich (one of the instructors) made fun of my code so that felt pretty shitty, but I assume he was meaning it a joking way, like, "Just wait til you're done, you'll look back at this and laugh at how silly some mistakes you made were." At least that's how I'm trying to take it.  
 * Python takes practice. Doing things over and over and over and over and trying to do them in new, more 'pythonic' ways. Think of it like spoke-language immersion. Once you get conversational, you can start talking about things other than 'Where is the bathroom?' Langauge immersion requires a lot of work and a lot of practice.

2. __Here's what it comes down to__  
 * Not having a STEM background feels like the left image below. Focusing on it as the right image gives me the confidence to keep learning. My fellow students and I approach problems in very different ways. And sometimes that it good. If you've coded a lot in R or MatLab and now want to try doing something in Python, there may be an easier way you might not think of because you're in the MatLab framework. I only know Python and SQL, so I can retrain my mind much quicker than others, and that can be a HUGE benefit as the course continues. Or not. I guess only time will tell.
